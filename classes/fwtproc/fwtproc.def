## Errors

ERROR:   FWT_DIM_ERROR
COMMENT: Length of frame %d isn't 2^n.
LEVEL:   EL_ERROR

## Fields

FIELD:   level
COMMENT: Transformation detail level. (max. level (default) = -1; If defined \
         level is greater then possible transformation depth, transformation \
         provides with max. detail level.)
TYPE:    short
INIT:    -1

FIELD:   wvltype
COMMENT: Wavelet type (available values: haar,d2,d4,d6,...,d20) 
TYPE:    string
INIT:    "d4"

METHOD:  -analyze
COMMENT: Run DWT.
SYNTAX:    (data idSignal, data idPitch, data idReal, data idImag)
